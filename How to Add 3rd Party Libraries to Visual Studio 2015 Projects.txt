How to add 3rd party libraries in Visual Studio 2015

first off it is useful to set up the file structure like so
/3rdPartyLibrary
	""/include
	""/lib
		""/""/86 or /64(optional inside lib)



which for include contains library code and lib includes the .lib and .dll(dll is not always needed)

If the .lib or .dll files are not included you may have to compile them from their respective projects

Inside Project Properties

-> C/C++ -> General -> Additional Include Directories
Add 

$(SolutionDir)3rdPartyLibrary\include

-> Linker -> General -> Addtional Library Directories ->  

Add

$(SolutionDir)3rdPartyLibrary\lib\(with x86 or x64 if needed)

-> Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies -> 

Add

3rdParty.lib

Finally,

add the specified #include <> within the .cpp and .h files following the setup folder structure and everything should compile successfully.
